- check ret val after while from _toks_get inside _parse. If it is equal to -1,
  then throw an error(may be after this we can remove a part of error related
  code from _load proc).
- add .= ?
- add ?.= or .?= ?
- add conf_get.tcl utility for getting a value of a specified key(on command line).
  It can be used from shell scripts, for example.
- replace CONFERR in error calls with something like {CONF ...}?
- add multiline value support?
  (add \\n (\ followed by newline) support for line continuation)
- autotests for += without previous =
- autotests for SECT_CH
- fix err with "Token input buffer". Place it after "Unexpected token sequence".
- remove debug info from "Unexpected token sequence" msg?
- rename SECT_CH to CS?
- autotest for += and ?=
- is value should last till the line end even in the absence of quotes? Like:
  key = some long value
- add mandatory comma for list items separation? It seems, that this can
  improve readability of lists for users.
