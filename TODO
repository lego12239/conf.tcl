- add save routines
- add spec param to save routines? spec will be used to specifying nested levels and
  values types.
- check ret val after while from _toks_get inside _parse. If it is equal to -1,
  then throw an error(may be after this we can remove a part of error related
  code from _load proc).
- add boolean support(yes/no, true/false, enable/disable without quotes).(Already
  exists?)
- add .= ?
- add conf_get.tcl utility for getting a value of a specified key(on command line).
  It can be used from shell scripts, for example.
- replace CONFERR in error calls with something like {CONF ...}?
- ret -3 from spec_key_existence if unknown type (see autotests spec_cmp-4.0 and
  spec_cmp-4.1). How can we test that value is single word without shimmering?
- do not ret "sect" from spec_key_get for unknown type (see autotest spec-1.5).
- add new err code(e.g. B - broken spec) for unknown type for _spec_cmp.
